Database performance is crucial for any application's success. Here are 10 essential tips to optimize your database for better performance and scalability.

## 1. Index Your Queries

Proper indexing is the foundation of good database performance:

```sql
-- Create an index on frequently queried columns
CREATE INDEX idx_user_email ON users(email);
CREATE INDEX idx_created_at ON posts(created_at);
```

## 2. Optimize Your Queries

Write efficient queries that minimize data retrieval:

```sql
-- Bad: SELECT *
SELECT * FROM users WHERE active = true;

-- Good: Select only needed columns
SELECT id, name, email FROM users WHERE active = true;
```

## 3. Use Query Plans

Analyze your query execution plans to identify bottlenecks:

```sql
EXPLAIN ANALYZE SELECT * FROM users 
JOIN posts ON users.id = posts.user_id 
WHERE users.created_at > '2024-01-01';
```

## 4. Implement Connection Pooling

Use connection pooling to manage database connections efficiently:

```typescript
import { Pool } from 'pg'

const pool = new Pool({
  connectionString: process.env.DATABASE_URL,
  max: 20,
  idleTimeoutMillis: 30000,
  connectionTimeoutMillis: 2000,
})
```

## 5. Normalize Your Data

Proper normalization reduces data redundancy and improves consistency:

- **First Normal Form (1NF)**: Eliminate duplicate data
- **Second Normal Form (2NF)**: Remove partial dependencies
- **Third Normal Form (3NF)**: Eliminate transitive dependencies

## 6. Use Caching Strategies

Implement caching at multiple levels:

- **Application-level caching** with Redis
- **Query result caching**
- **Database-level caching**

## 7. Monitor Performance Metrics

Keep track of key performance indicators:

- Query execution time
- Connection pool utilization
- Cache hit ratios
- Lock wait times

## 8. Partition Large Tables

For very large tables, consider partitioning:

```sql
-- Range partitioning by date
CREATE TABLE orders_2024 PARTITION OF orders
FOR VALUES FROM ('2024-01-01') TO ('2025-01-01');
```

## 9. Regular Maintenance

Perform regular database maintenance:

- **VACUUM** to reclaim storage space
- **ANALYZE** to update statistics
- **REINDEX** to rebuild indexes

## 10. Choose the Right Data Types

Use appropriate data types for your data:

```sql
-- Use specific data types
CREATE TABLE products (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    price DECIMAL(10,2) NOT NULL,  -- Not FLOAT
    created_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,  -- Not VARCHAR
    status SMALLINT NOT NULL        -- Not INTEGER for small values
);
```

## Conclusion

Database optimization is an ongoing process that requires monitoring, testing, and continuous improvement. Start with these fundamental techniques and gradually implement more advanced optimizations as needed.

Remember: **measure first, optimize second**. Always profile your application to identify actual bottlenecks before implementing optimizations.
